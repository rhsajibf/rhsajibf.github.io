Breast Cancer Prediction Using KNN;projects/images/project-1.png;Python;Pandas;Matplotlib;https://github.com/rhsajibf/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-KNN;This project employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the malignancy of breast tumors using data sourced from a CSV file. By extracting crucial features from medical records, this machine learning model enhances the accuracy of breast cancer predictions, facilitating early detection.
House Rent Prediction using Linear Regression;projects/images/project-2.png;Python;Pandas;Matplotlib;Numpy;https://github.com/rhsajibf/House-Rent-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression;In this project, I employ Linear Regression to predict house rent based on the area of the property. By analyzing historical data that correlates area sizes with corresponding rental prices, this model provides a straightforward and effective tool for estimating rents.
